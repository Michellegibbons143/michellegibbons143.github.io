# Michelle Gibbons Portfolio Website

This repository hosts the source code for my **GitHub Pages portfolio**: [michellegibbons143.github.io](https://michellegibbons143.github.io/).

It contains all the files used to build and style the portfolio site, including:

- HTML files  
- CSS stylesheets
- Images and assets  

The portfolio highlights my skills in **data analytics and engineering**, showcases personal projects, and provides ways to connect with me professionally.

## ⚡ Note

This repo is for hosting and maintaining the portfolio website. For individual project code, please visit my **[GitHub projects repositories](https://github.com/michellegibbons143?tab=repositories)**.
